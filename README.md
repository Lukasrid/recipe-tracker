### Agile Planning
The development of a recipe sharing website requires an organized and efficient approach. Agile methodology provides a flexible and iterative framework that promotes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Here is an overview of the Agile plan for creating this recipe sharing website.

The first sprint, "Project Setup," focuses on establishing the project foundation. This includes setting up the repository and version control system, defining project goals and user stories, and creating a basic Django project structure. User registration and authentication functionality are implemented to ensure a secure and personalized experience. Database models for recipes and user profiles are developed, and initial templates are created.

In the second sprint, "Recipe Browsing and Searching," the focus shifts to enhancing the user's ability to discover and explore recipes. Recipe listing functionality is implemented, allowing users to browse recipes based on cuisines. The search functionality is developed, enabling users to find recipes through keywords and ingredients. A detailed recipe view is created, providing users with comprehensive information, including ingredients, methodology and descriptions. Pagination is added to the recipe listing to enhance user experience, enabling them to navigate through numerous recipes efficiently. Additionally, a feedback functionality is incorporated, allowing users to provide their thoughts and experiences.

The third sprint, "Recipe Management," empowers registered users to contribute to the website by creating and editing their own recipes. The implementation of image upload functionality enhances the visual appeal of recipes. Validation and error handling mechanisms are put in place to ensure accurate and reliable recipe creation and editing.

In the fourth sprint, "User Experience Enhancements," the focus shifts towards improving the overall user interface and experience. The website's design is refined to be visually appealing and user-friendly. Search functionality is enhanced with filtering options to facilitate quicker and more accurate recipe discovery.

The final sprint, "Deployment and Final Touches," involves the deployment of the website on Heroku. Extensive testing and bug fixing are conducted to ensure a stable and error-free experience. Documentation, including a comprehensive README and user guides, is refined to assist users in understanding and utilizing the website effectively. Finally, the project is prepared for presentation and submission.
